### Image icon

Icon component that displays old sensenet image icons by their names. In the old versions of sensenet, the icons were stored in the Global folder by their name and size as /Root/Global/icons/{size:16|32}/{iconname}. This component contains the old image icons, so if you set an old icon name, it will display the old image icon that was in the old versions.
