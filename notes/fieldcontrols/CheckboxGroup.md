### CheckboxGroup

The CheckBoxGroup Field Control **displays a list of checkboxes for selecting an option** from a single- or multiple-selection Choice field.

When the underlying Choice Field is configured to allow extra value an extra textbox is rendered next to the dropdown control. The CheckBoxGroup Field Control renders a Label control in Browse mode and a CheckBoxList accompanied with a TextBox - the latter for an optional extra value - in Edit mode.
