### FileName

The FileName Field Control is a Field Control that provides an interface to **display/modify the Name of file typed Content**. The FileName is a fragment of the Content Path, it cannot contain special characters and is stored in a ShortText Field defined on GenericContent Content Type.

It works and displayed the same way as the Name field control except it has a suffix for the extension, that cannot be modified.
